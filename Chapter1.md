# Hands on Machine Learning with Python

Chapter 1: 

Theory Questions : 
1. How would you define machine learning?
A computer program is said to learn from Experience E with respect to a task T and a performance metric P if its performance measured by P on some task T improves with E. 

2. Can you name four types of applications where it shines?
A) Problems which require a long list of rules and fine tuning. 
B) Complex problems which have no algorithmic solutions
C) Fluctuating Environment which change the code data input. 
D) Getting insights about Complex Problems which involves large amount of data.

3. What is a labeled training set?
In supervised learning the training set contains the desired solutions called labels. 


4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
Classification and regression are examples of supervised tasks. Example : Classification of Emails to Spam or Ham. Regression or prediction
of target sales price of car models. Remember Regression to the mean.

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
Clustering visitors of a Blog based on their features. 
Anomaly detection to detect credit card frauds.
Dimensionality Reduction merges several correlated features to simplify data
Visualization Tasks.
Associated learning to find patterns in data. People who buy potato also buy steak.

6. What type of algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walkin various unknown terrains?
Reinforcement Learning trains agents known as bots to continually improve themselves through a reward mechanism.

7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
This can be done using a clustering algorithm. The number of groups can be specified before. 

8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
A spam detection can be a supervised and non-supervised learning problem depending on the available data set.
If the available data set is labelled then it can be treated as a supervised learning problem.

9. What is an online learning system?
Opposed to batch learning[Offline learning], in this process the system gets data in small batches called mini-batches and learns incrementally. 
Learning is fast and cheap. Learning can be controlled using the learning rate parameter. High learning rate results in forgetfullness. 

10. What is out-of-core learning?
When the dataset is big that it can not be fit in a computer it is called out-of-core learning. Offline learning approach is used in this case.
Might be confusing.

11. What type of algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?
In instance based learning the computer learns by memorizing the data and uses a similarity measure to make predictions 

12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a model hyperparameter?

13. What do model-based algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?
After the initial model selection. The task is to optimise the selected model parameters. This is done either by using a loss function or a 
utility function. 

14. Can you name four of the main challenges in machine learning?
